## Share - v1.0

This project's ethereum logic is based largely off the logic developed here: https://github.com/escobard/blockchains-nd-term1/tree/master/part4/project5

## Project Criteria

The main purpose of this product is to develop a production ready web application, that interacts with the rinkeby test network to create a donation platform using the ethereum protocol.

To achieve this, the following technologies are utilized:

1) Heroku & GCP for automatic deployment / hosting of the UI / API layers.
2) Github for source control and Waffle.io for scrum.
2) React for the UI with `create-react-app` for quick bundling and deployment.
3) Node with Express for the API with Mongoose as the ORM to connect to a (potential) MongoDB oracle.
5) Ethereum network interaction with Truffle to test, compile, develop, and deploy smart contracts.

Each of these will have a `github branch` which is how the `advancement of each part of the stack` will be tracked.

The other purpose is to showcase my capabilities with the following:
 - automatic deployment pipelines
 - continuous integration between host and repository
 - proper scrum usage
 - real-world usage of blockchain technology
 - use various JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and tools to interact with the Ethereum protocol.

Lastly, this product will be used as the boilerplate for both the 6B (as share 1.0) and Capstone (as share 2.0) projects.
