The main criteria with the Ethereum layer of this web application is to create logic to facilitate charitable contributions.

The secondary purpose of the Ethereum logic is to collect 4% of charitable contributions in a lottery that will be gifted at the end of the month to select users.

Lastly, 1% of charitable donations are given back to the business.

## Usage

This will be expanded with usage instructions for the UI and for deployment with heroku later.

### UI

Refer to the README.md file within the `./ui` directory.

### Truffle

Metamask must be installed to use the application to interact with the deployed smart contract. 
You can download, and learn more about metamask here: [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)

1) Navigate to the parent directory, with a command terminal.
2) Run the following command to start the application on port 8000 `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
    1) python must be installed for this to work, node.js will be used in the react version.
3) If privacy mode is enabled with your metamask account, accept the prompt.
    1) if privacy mode is not enabled, the application will grab injected web3 instance from metamask
4) Fill out the form to create your star.
    1) The user can track the status of the transaction in the console log.
5) Once successful, star details are displayed under the star form.
6) The user can retrieve the star from the network, by entering the star's tokenId.

#### Truffle - Testing

1) Navigate to the `/smart_contracts` folder
1) Run `npm install` - `truffle.js must be installed globally`
2) Start a ganache node, currently set to use the desktop application instead of cli.
    - To change this to CLI head to `./truffle.js` and change line 10 from `7545` to `8545`.
3) Once ganache is up and running, run the command `truffle test`
4) 18 tests should pass with various functionality of the 3 token contracts. 

#### Truffle -  Deployment

1) Navigate to the `/smart_contracts` folder
2) Open `truffle.js`
3) Change the `mnemonic` variable value on `line 3` to your own rinkeby mnemonic.
4) Change the `URI on line 16 to infura` with your own `pod URI`
5) Run the `truffle migrate --network rinkeby --reset` command.
